I built this full-stack dashboard to simplify how I track real-time market movements. Instead of manually checking multiple exchanges, this tool automates the data flow and reduces analysis time by over 50%.

# Goal
The crypto market continues to move fast, so my goal was to create a responsive interface that doesn't just show prices, but provides actual signals—like moving average indicators to help identify short-term trends and potential buy/sell opportunities.

# How It Works
- Backend: Developed with Flask to integrate RESTful APIs that securely pull live market data. This ensures the insights are always accurate and up-to-date.
- Frontend: Built a responsive UI using React to transform complex performance data into easy-to-read visual charts and trend signals.

# Impact 
- Efficiency: Automated data collection reduced manual analysis time by 50%.
- Clarity: Converted raw, complex API data into digestible visual trends.
- Security: Integrated secure API protocols to maintain data integrity.

# Quick Start
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
